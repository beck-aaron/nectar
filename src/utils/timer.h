// TODO wrap timer utility here, essentially when a timer is init, it records
// the time of initialization.  Every time, the timer_expired function is called,
// the current system time is subtracted from the timer start time to determine
// how long the timer has been running for.  If this time is greater or equal to
// the timer value that it was initialized with, the function returns true.
